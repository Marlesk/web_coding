       <h4 class="text-primary-emphasis"> <i class="fa-regular fa-user"></i> About me</h4>
       <p> I am a graduate in Mathematics and Biostatistics with a strong background in data analysis, programming, and statistics. I have hands-on experience with programming languages such as Python, MySQL, R, and more, which I’ve applied both in academic projects and practical settings. During my studies, I used R programming to develop mathematical models for analyzing clinical trial data, merging my mathematical knowledge with real-world applications.

      Driven by a passion for Programming and Web Development, I have recently started the Coding Factory program to deepen my skills in these areas. I am excited to expand my knowledge of coding, web development, and software engineering, while continuing to solve complex problems in creative ways.
        
      Currently, I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst, Software/Data Engineer, or Biostatistician where I can apply my skills and further my growth in coding, data analysis, and web development.</p>

          Bayesian methods can mitigate the borrowing of historical data through power prior distribution. Power prior distributions are a useful tool for incorporation data from one or more historical studies. However, the incorporation of historical data can increase the type I error. The idea of dynamic lending is to recognize when current data appears to be incompatible with historical data. A recent publication deals with the aforementioned issue in an empirical Bayes manner, taking into account the discrepancy between past and current data, with type I error as a ruler. The method is described for continuous, normally distributed data. Extension to the case of dichotomous outcomes was the goal of this thesis. We extended the methodology for Bayesian hypothesis testing using posterior probabilities. The method was employed in re-designing a clinical trial from the field of oncology. We used R for programming and coding, utilizing simulation and Bayesian methods to extend this methodology to clinical trials (Phase I, II, and III).
